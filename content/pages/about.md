Hi there! I’m Błażej Gutowski, an IT professional with a strong background in managing complex network and server environments. My passion for technology goes beyond just keeping systems running—I’ve always been fascinated by exploring new tools, gadgets, and technologies. I take pride in understanding how things work beneath the surface, a curiosity that has driven me to transition into cybersecurity and penetration testing. Fun fact: my love for technology even extends to pop culture—shows like _Mr. Robot_ have been a source of inspiration for my journey into the exciting world of ethical hacking.

What excites me most about cybersecurity is the opportunity to make applications and systems safer and more secure for everyone. The idea of uncovering vulnerabilities and contributing to a more robust digital environment motivates me every day. While I’m still gaining hands-on experience in web penetration testing, I’m confident in my skills with tools like Burp Suite and scripting, which I use to automate complex tasks in my current role. I’m eager to further develop my expertise in web pentesting and turn this passion into a career.

When I’m not diving into the world of IT and cybersecurity, you can find me enjoying life outside of work. I’m an MMA enthusiast, an avid snowboarder during the winter months, and I love spending time outdoors with my dog, Enzo. Traveling and discovering new places and cultures is another passion of mine, as it gives me fresh perspectives and inspires my personal and professional growth. One of my biggest dreams is to one day share my knowledge on a global stage, like giving a talk at DEF CON. Until then, I’m committed to learning, growing, and contributing to the cybersecurity community one step at a time.

Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope it inspires and informs you as much as it reflects my journey and aspirations!
